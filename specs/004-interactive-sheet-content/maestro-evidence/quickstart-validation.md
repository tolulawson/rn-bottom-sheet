Date: 2026-02-13

## Checklist

- [x] Baseline validation commands pass (`yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn test`).

- [x] Width contract behavior remains stable across detent changes (fit/medium/large assertions via Maestro).
- [x] Single-detent restriction patterns remain supported (`fit`, `medium`, `large`) and covered by tests.
- [x] Consumer-managed flow transitions are stable across detent changes and dismiss/reopen cycles.
- [x] Styling controls validated (`preferredColorScheme`, `contentBackgroundStyle`, `contentBackgroundBlurStyle`) in unit/integration coverage and runtime flow.
- [x] Required Maestro flows executed and passed.
- [x] README/docs updates present for API scope, support matrix, styling limits, and navigation non-goals.
