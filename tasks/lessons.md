- Trigger: User clarified "tax" meant "tasks" and requested direct execution.
- Mistake Pattern: Treating ambiguous phrasing as a blocking clarification point instead of acting on clear intent.
- Prevention Rule: When user intent is operationally clear, execute directly and interpret minor wording ambiguity in context.
- Action Taken: Added docs/tasks scaffolding and committed plan artifacts without further gating.
