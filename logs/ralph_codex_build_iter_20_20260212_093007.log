# Ralph Build Mode

Based on Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph Wiggum methodology.

---

## Phase 0: Orient

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to understand project principles and constraints.

---

## Phase 1: Discover Work Items

Search for incomplete work from these sources (in order):

1. **specs/ folder** — Look for `.md` files NOT marked `## Status: COMPLETE`
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** — If exists, find unchecked `- [ ]` tasks
3. **GitHub Issues** — Check for open issues (if this is a GitHub repo)
4. **Any task tracker** — Jira, Linear, etc. if configured

Pick the **HIGHEST PRIORITY** incomplete item:
- Lower numbers = higher priority (001 before 010)
- `[HIGH]` before `[MEDIUM]` before `[LOW]`
- Bugs/blockers before features

Before implementing, search the codebase to verify it's not already done.

---

## Phase 1b: Re-Verification Mode (No Incomplete Work Found)

**If ALL specs appear complete**, don't just exit — do a quality check:

1. **Randomly pick** one completed spec from `specs/`
2. **Strictly re-verify** ALL its acceptance criteria:
   - Run the actual tests mentioned in the spec
   - Manually verify each criterion is truly met
   - Check edge cases
   - Look for regressions
3. **If any criterion fails**: Unmark the spec as complete and fix it
4. **If all pass**: Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` to confirm quality

This ensures the codebase stays healthy even when "nothing to do."

---

## Phase 2: Implement

Implement the selected spec/task completely:
- Follow the spec's requirements exactly
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Add tests as needed

---

## Phase 3: Validate

Run the project's test suite and verify:
- All tests pass
- No lint errors
- The spec's acceptance criteria are 100% met

---

## Phase 3b: Conditional Maestro MCP E2E Gate (Example App)

Identify the active feature spec and check its E2E gate marker:
- Look for `E2E Gate State: deferred|required` in `specs/<feature>/spec.md`.
- Default to `deferred` if the marker is missing.

Gate behavior:
- If `deferred`: do NOT block this loop iteration. Log that Maestro MCP was skipped and why.
- If `required`: Maestro MCP is a hard gate for completion.

When `required`, run Maestro MCP against the example app and verify at least:
- sheet opens from example UI
- sheet dismisses cleanly
- detent interaction works
- primary in-sheet navigation flow works

If any required Maestro MCP flow fails, do NOT output `<promise>DONE</promise>`.

---

## Phase 4: Commit & Update

1. Mark the spec/task as complete (add `## Status: COMPLETE` to spec file)
2. `git add -A`
3. `git commit` with a descriptive message
4. `git push`

---

## Completion Signal

**CRITICAL:** Only output the magic phrase when the work is 100% complete.

Check:
- [ ] Implementation matches all requirements
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Maestro MCP gate satisfied (or explicitly deferred in the active spec)
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Spec marked as complete

**If ALL checks pass, output:** `<promise>DONE</promise>`

**If ANY check fails:** Fix the issue and try again. Do NOT output the magic phrase.

mcp: context7 starting
mcp: maestro starting
mcp: codex_apps starting
mcp: codex_apps ready
mcp: maestro ready
mcp: context7 ready
mcp startup: ready: codex_apps, maestro, context7

**Starting Ralph Build Mode with plan**
codex
I’m going to run the Ralph loop end-to-end: first I’ll load the project constitution and the `ralph-wiggum` skill instructions, then I’ll discover the highest-priority incomplete work and write a checkable plan in `tasks/todo.md` before implementing.

# Ralph Wiggum

> Autonomous AI coding with spec-driven development

## What is Ralph Wiggum?

Ralph Wiggum combines **Geoffrey Huntley's iterative bash loop** with **spec-driven development** for fully autonomous AI-assisted software development.

The key insight: **Fresh context each iteration**. Each loop starts a new agent process with a clean context window, preventing context overflow and degradation.

# Feature Specification: Native iOS Sheet Bindings

**Feature Branch**: `001-native-ios-sheet-bindings`  
**Created**: 2026-02-12  
**Status**: Complete  
**Input**: User description: "Build a React Native library that provides native iOS sheet bindings using Nitro Views with React Native children, dynamic detents, React Navigation integration, in-sheet navigation, and Reanimated-compatible APIs."

## Status: COMPLETE

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Present Native Sheet Content (Priority: P1)

As a React Native developer, I can present and dismiss a native-feeling iOS sheet that renders arbitrary React Native child content so that product experiences match Apple sheet behavior.

**Why this priority**: This is the core product value and the minimum viable capability for the package.

**Independent Test**: In an example app, the developer can open/close a sheet and see custom React Native children rendered correctly without writing custom native code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

# Tasks: Native iOS Sheet Bindings

**Input**: Design documents from `/Users/tolu/Desktop/dev/rn-bottom-sheet/specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Include tests because the specification requires automated verification coverage for API and integration behavior.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (`[US1]`, `[US2]`, `[US3]`)

- Trigger: User clarified "tax" meant "tasks" and requested direct execution.
- Mistake Pattern: Treating ambiguous phrasing as a blocking clarification point instead of acting on clear intent.
- Prevention Rule: When user intent is operationally clear, execute directly and interpret minor wording ambiguity in context.
- Action Taken: Added docs/tasks scaffolding and committed plan artifacts without further gating.

- Date: 2026-02-12

No external tracker resources are configured (`list_mcp_resources` returned empty), so the active target stays the completed spec `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md` for strict re-verification.

Plan check-in before execution:
1. Add a new checklist section to `tasks/todo.md` for this Ralph pass.
2. Re-run discovery checks (`specs`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, GitHub issues) and confirm no open work.
3. Re-verify acceptance criteria by running the verification gates (`yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn test`, `yarn docs:check`) plus native iOS build.
4. Evaluate the spec’s Maestro gate marker and record deferred/required handling.
5. Append a review addendum in `tasks/todo.md` with concrete evidence, then finalize with `<promise>DONE</promise>` only if all gates pass.

  - `yarn typecheck` passed.
  - `yarn test` passed (`13/13` suites, `44` passed tests, `19` todo).
  - `yarn docs:check` passed (`Knowledge base check passed`).
  - `xcodebuild -workspace example/ios/rnBottomSheetExample.xcworkspace -scheme RnBottomSheetExample -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build` passed (`** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
- Maestro gate outcome:
  - `E2E Gate State` in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md` remains `deferred`; Maestro MCP is explicitly non-blocking and was intentionally not treated as a hard gate in this pass.

+- Discovery verification:

+  - `list_mcp_resources` returned no configured tracker resources (`{"resources":[]}`).
+  - Random completed-spec selection resolved to `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md`.
+- Acceptance and edge-case re-verification:
+  - User Story 1 behavior (open, dismiss, lifecycle ordering, in-sheet interaction) remains covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.presenter.integration.test.tsx`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.lifecycle.test.ts`, and `example/src/__tests__/sheet-open-dismiss.integration.test.tsx`.
+  - User Story 2 behavior (detent initialization, snap behavior, invalid-input diagnostics) remains covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.detent.integration.test.tsx`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.detents.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.methods.test.ts`, and `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.wrapper.test.ts`.
+  - User Story 3 behavior (navigation synchronization, in-sheet navigation, Reanimated compatibility) remains covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.navigation.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet-adapter.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.reanimated.test.ts`, and `example/src/__tests__/sheet-open-dismiss.integration.test.tsx`.

+  - Single active session ownership remains implemented in `ios/RnBottomSheet.swift` via `SingleActiveSheetSessionCoordinator`.
+- Validation gates:
+  - `yarn lint` passed (0 errors, 3 warnings from generated `coverage/lcov-report/*` files).
+  - `yarn typecheck` passed.
+  - `yarn test` passed (`13/13` suites, `44` passed tests, `19` todo); watchman emitted a recrawl warning without affecting test outcomes.
+  - `yarn docs:check` passed (`Knowledge base check passed`).
+  - `xcodebuild -workspace example/ios/rnBottomSheetExample.xcworkspace -scheme RnBottomSheetExample -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build` passed (`** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
+- Maestro gate outcome:
+  - `E2E Gate State` in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md` remains `deferred`; Maestro MCP is explicitly non-blocking and was intentionally skipped as a hard gate in this round.

**Updating plan progress**
Plan update
  ✓ Append a new Ralph re-verification checklist section in tasks/todo.md
  ✓ Re-run discovery checks for incomplete work and open issues/trackers
  ✓ Execute validation gates (lint, typecheck, test, docs) and iOS build
  ✓ Record Maestro gate disposition and re-verification evidence in tasks/todo.md
  → Finalize completion signal if all gates pass

-- [ ] Confirm no incomplete work remains across `specs/`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, GitHub issues, and configured trackers
-- [ ] Randomly select one completed spec and lock strict re-verification target
-- [ ] Re-verify all acceptance scenarios and edge cases in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md`

+## Review Addendum (2026-02-12, Re-Verification Mode Round 5)
+
+- Discovery verification:
+  - `rg -n "^- \\[ \\]" specs IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md --glob "*.md"` returned `NO_UNCHECKED_ITEMS`.
+  - `gh issue list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,labels,updatedAt,url` returned `[]`.
+  - `list_mcp_resources` returned no configured tracker resources (`{"resources":[]}`).
+  - Random completed-spec selection resolved to `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md`.
+- Acceptance and edge-case re-verification:
+  - User Story 1 behavior (open, dismiss, lifecycle ordering, in-sheet interaction) remains covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.presenter.integration.test.tsx`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.lifecycle.test.ts`, and `example/src/__tests__/sheet-open-dismiss.integration.test.tsx`.
+  - User Story 2 behavior (detent initialization, snap behavior, invalid-input diagnostics) remains covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.detent.integration.test.tsx`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.detents.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.methods.test.ts`, and `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.wrapper.test.ts`.
+  - User Story 3 behavior (navigation synchronization, in-sheet navigation, Reanimated compatibility) remains covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.navigation.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet-adapter.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.reanimated.test.ts`, and `example/src/__tests__/sheet-open-dismiss.integration.test.tsx`.
+  - Non-iOS fallback behavior remains deterministic and covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.fallback.test.ts`.
+  - Single active session ownership remains implemented in `ios/RnBottomSheet.swift` via `SingleActiveSheetSessionCoordinator`.
+- Validation gates:
+  - `yarn lint` passed (0 errors, 3 warnings from generated `coverage/lcov-report/*` files).
+  - `yarn typecheck` passed.
+  - `yarn test` passed (`13/13` suites, `44` passed tests, `19` todo); watchman emitted a recrawl warning without affecting test outcomes.
+  - `yarn docs:check` passed (`Knowledge base check passed`).
+  - `xcodebuild -workspace example/ios/rnBottomSheetExample.xcworkspace -scheme RnBottomSheetExample -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build` passed (`** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
+- Maestro gate outcome:
+  - `E2E Gate State` in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md` remains `deferred`; Maestro MCP is explicitly non-blocking and was intentionally skipped as a hard gate in this round.

**Marking plan completion**
Plan update
  ✓ Append a new Ralph re-verification checklist section in tasks/todo.md
  ✓ Re-run discovery checks for incomplete work and open issues/trackers
  ✓ Execute validation gates (lint, typecheck, test, docs) and iOS build
  ✓ Record Maestro gate disposition and re-verification evidence in tasks/todo.md
  ✓ Finalize completion signal if all gates pass
