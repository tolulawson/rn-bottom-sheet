# Ralph Build Mode

Based on Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph Wiggum methodology.

---

## Phase 0: Orient

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to understand project principles and constraints.

---

## Phase 1: Discover Work Items

Search for incomplete work from these sources (in order):

1. **specs/ folder** — Look for `.md` files NOT marked `## Status: COMPLETE`
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** — If exists, find unchecked `- [ ]` tasks
3. **GitHub Issues** — Check for open issues (if this is a GitHub repo)
4. **Any task tracker** — Jira, Linear, etc. if configured

Pick the **HIGHEST PRIORITY** incomplete item:
- Lower numbers = higher priority (001 before 010)
- `[HIGH]` before `[MEDIUM]` before `[LOW]`
- Bugs/blockers before features

Before implementing, search the codebase to verify it's not already done.

---

## Phase 1b: Re-Verification Mode (No Incomplete Work Found)

**If ALL specs appear complete**, don't just exit — do a quality check:

1. **Randomly pick** one completed spec from `specs/`
2. **Strictly re-verify** ALL its acceptance criteria:
   - Run the actual tests mentioned in the spec
   - Manually verify each criterion is truly met
   - Check edge cases
   - Look for regressions
3. **If any criterion fails**: Unmark the spec as complete and fix it
4. **If all pass**: Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` to confirm quality

This ensures the codebase stays healthy even when "nothing to do."

---

## Phase 2: Implement

Implement the selected spec/task completely:
- Follow the spec's requirements exactly
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Add tests as needed

---

## Phase 3: Validate

Run the project's test suite and verify:
- All tests pass
- No lint errors
- The spec's acceptance criteria are 100% met

---

## Phase 3b: Conditional Maestro MCP E2E Gate (Example App)

Identify the active feature spec and check its E2E gate marker:
- Look for `E2E Gate State: deferred|required` in `specs/<feature>/spec.md`.
- Default to `deferred` if the marker is missing.

Gate behavior:
- If `deferred`: do NOT block this loop iteration. Log that Maestro MCP was skipped and why.
- If `required`: Maestro MCP is a hard gate for completion.

When `required`, run Maestro MCP against the example app and verify at least:
- sheet opens from example UI
- sheet dismisses cleanly
- detent interaction works
- primary in-sheet navigation flow works

If any required Maestro MCP flow fails, do NOT output `<promise>DONE</promise>`.

---

## Phase 4: Commit & Update

1. Mark the spec/task as complete (add `## Status: COMPLETE` to spec file)
2. `git add -A`
3. `git commit` with a descriptive message
4. `git push`

---

## Completion Signal

**CRITICAL:** Only output the magic phrase when the work is 100% complete.

Check:
- [ ] Implementation matches all requirements
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Maestro MCP gate satisfied (or explicitly deferred in the active spec)
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Spec marked as complete

**If ALL checks pass, output:** `<promise>DONE</promise>`

**If ANY check fails:** Fix the issue and try again. Do NOT output the magic phrase.

mcp: context7 starting
mcp: maestro starting
mcp: codex_apps starting
mcp: codex_apps ready
mcp: maestro ready
mcp: context7 ready
mcp startup: ready: codex_apps, maestro, context7

# Feature Specification: Native iOS Sheet Bindings

**Feature Branch**: `001-native-ios-sheet-bindings`  
**Created**: 2026-02-12  
**Status**: Complete  
**Input**: User description: "Build a React Native library that provides native iOS sheet bindings using Nitro Views with React Native children, dynamic detents, React Navigation integration, in-sheet navigation, and Reanimated-compatible APIs."

## Status: COMPLETE

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Present Native Sheet Content (Priority: P1)

As a React Native developer, I can present and dismiss a native-feeling iOS sheet that renders arbitrary React Native child content so that product experiences match Apple sheet behavior.

**Why this priority**: This is the core product value and the minimum viable capability for the package.

**Independent Test**: In an example app, the developer can open/close a sheet and see custom React Native children rendered correctly without writing custom native code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

# Tasks: Native iOS Sheet Bindings

**Input**: Design documents from `/Users/tolu/Desktop/dev/rn-bottom-sheet/specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Include tests because the specification requires automated verification coverage for API and integration behavior.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (`[US1]`, `[US2]`, `[US3]`)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare feature scaffolding, generated bindings workflow, and test harness entry points.

- [x] T001 Create feature README entry and scope note in docs/changelog-notes/README.md
 succeeded in 51ms:
# Implementation Todo

## Phase 0: Project Memory Bootstrap

- [x] Create `docs/` knowledge base structure
- [x] Add decision-complete implementation plan
- [x] Add reference summaries and source index
- [x] Add ADRs for primary architecture decisions
- [x] Add sync/check scripts for docs integrity

## Phase 1: API and Nitro Contract

- [x] Finalize public TypeScript API and Nitro view contract
- [x] Regenerate Nitrogen artifacts
- [x] Validate typings and exports

## Phase 2: iOS Sheet Engine

- [x] Implement presenter/controller architecture
- [x] Map detent model and lifecycle events

I have the acceptance criteria and gate state (`deferred`). Next I’ll append a fresh re-verification checklist to `tasks/todo.md`, then I’ll execute each verification item and only switch items to complete after evidence is captured.

Entered plan mode for Ralph re-verification workflow because no incomplete spec tasks are currently visible.
  → Confirm there are no incomplete items in specs, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, and issue trackers
  • Map spec acceptance criteria to concrete evidence locations (tests/code) and identify any gaps
  • Run verification commands (lint, typecheck, tests, docs checks) and capture results
  • Evaluate Maestro conditional gate state and required actions
  • Update tasks/todo review notes and close checklist; if failures are found, unmark spec complete and implement fixes

  - `list_mcp_resources` returned no configured external tracker resources.
- Random spec selection:
  - Only completed candidate in `specs/` is `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md`; selected for strict re-verification.
- Acceptance and edge-case re-verification:
  - US1 open/dismiss/interactive-content acceptance scenarios remain covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.presenter.integration.test.tsx`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.lifecycle.test.ts`, and `example/src/__tests__/sheet-open-dismiss.integration.test.tsx`.
  - US2 detent initialization/snap/validation acceptance scenarios remain covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.detent.integration.test.tsx`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.detents.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.methods.test.ts`, and `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.wrapper.test.ts`.

  - Non-iOS deterministic fallback edge-case behavior remains covered by `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.fallback.test.ts`.
  - Concurrent/rapid-open deterministic one-active-session behavior remains implemented in `ios/RnBottomSheet.swift` (`NativeSheetSessionCoordinator`) and guarded by presenter-integration flow assertions.

**Marking plan statuses complete**
Plan update
Completed re-verification workflow for the selected completed spec, including command gates and native build validation.
  ✓ Confirm there are no incomplete items in specs, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, and issue trackers
  ✓ Map spec acceptance criteria to concrete evidence locations (tests/code) and identify any gaps
  ✓ Run verification commands (lint, typecheck, tests, docs checks) and capture results
  ✓ Evaluate Maestro conditional gate state and required actions
  ✓ Update tasks/todo review notes and close checklist; if failures are found, unmark spec complete and implement fixes
