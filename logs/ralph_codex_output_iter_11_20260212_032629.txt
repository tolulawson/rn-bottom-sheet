Completed one Ralph iteration for the highest-priority incomplete spec task `T026` (Reanimated contract tests).

Changes made:
- Added reanimated compatibility contract tests in `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.reanimated.test.ts:1`.
- Marked `T026` complete in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md:99`.
- Updated iteration checklist and review log in `tasks/todo.md:63` and `tasks/todo.md:184`.

Validation run:
- `yarn lint` passed.
- `yarn typecheck` passed.
- `yarn test` passed (all suites passing; non-blocking watchman recrawl warning shown).

E2E gate:
- Maestro MCP was skipped because active spec gate is deferred (`specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md:99`).

Git:
- Commit: `98ec803` (`test: add reanimated compatibility contract coverage`)
- Pushed to `origin/main`.

I did not output `<promise>DONE</promise>` because the feature spec is still not fully complete (remaining unchecked tasks like `T027+` and spec status still draft).
