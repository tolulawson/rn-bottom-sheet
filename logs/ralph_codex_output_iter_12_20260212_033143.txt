Completed one Ralph loop iteration for the highest-priority incomplete spec task: `T027` in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md`.

- Added navigation adapter helpers in `src/navigation/bottom-sheet-adapter.ts`:
  - `createBottomSheetNavigationAdapter(...)`
  - `useBottomSheetNavigation(...)`
- Added unit coverage in `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet-adapter.test.ts` for:
  - route-state -> `isOpen` mapping
  - route open/close callback propagation
  - loop-prevention when state is already aligned
- Marked task complete in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md`.
- Recorded plan + review results in `tasks/todo.md`.

Validation run:
- `yarn lint` passed
- `yarn typecheck` passed
- `yarn test` passed (10 suites, 32 passed tests)

Git:
- Commit: `d7b383e`
- Message: `feat: add navigation adapter helpers for bottom sheet`
- Pushed to `origin/main`

Gate note:
- `E2E Gate State` in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md` is still `deferred`, so Maestro MCP was not a blocking gate this iteration.

I did not output `<promise>DONE</promise>` because there are still incomplete spec tasks (`T028+`).
