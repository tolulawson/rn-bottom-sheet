Implemented one Ralph iteration for the highest-priority incomplete spec task: `T025`.

Changes pushed on `main` in commit `ebb7127`:
- Added navigation-sync tests in `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.navigation.test.ts`
- Marked `T025` complete in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md:98`
- Added iteration plan/checklist + review notes in `tasks/todo.md`

What the new tests verify:
- Controlled `isOpen` stays in sync with external (route-like) state updates
- Native close intent is forwarded via `onOpenChange` without forcing native dismiss in controlled mode
- Controlled imperative `present`/`dismiss` uses callback-only flow to avoid loops

Validation run and passing:
- `yarn lint`
- `yarn typecheck`
- `yarn test`

I did not output `<promise>DONE</promise>` because the feature spec is still not fully complete (remaining unchecked tasks exist).
