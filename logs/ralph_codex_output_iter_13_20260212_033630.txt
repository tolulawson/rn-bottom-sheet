Selected and completed highest-priority truly incomplete spec task: `T028` (US3) from `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md:104`.

Changes made:
- Exported navigation adapter APIs and types from package root in `src/index.tsx:86`.
- Marked `T028` complete in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md:104`.
- Added iteration plan/results tracking in `tasks/todo.md:209` and review notes in `tasks/todo.md:97`.

Validation:
- Ran `yarn lint && yarn typecheck && yarn test` successfully.
- Jest result: 10/10 suites passed, 32 tests passed.

Git:
- Commit: `a2713ab` (`feat: export navigation adapter APIs from package root`)
- Pushed to `origin/main`.

Ralph gate status:
- `E2E Gate State` in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md` is `deferred`, so Maestro MCP is non-blocking and was skipped this iteration.
- Remaining incomplete tasks exist (`T029+`), so `<promise>DONE</promise>` is not emitted.

Next step:
1. Continue with `T029` (`src/components/BottomSheetNativeView.tsx`) as the next highest-priority unchecked spec task.
