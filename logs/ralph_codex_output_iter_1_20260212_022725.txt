Completed one full Ralph iteration for the highest active Phase 1 blocker (contract/codegen/typecheck), and pushed it.

- Fixed Nitro codegen blockers in `src/RnBottomSheet.nitro.ts` by extracting `NativeDetentType` and making `NativeBackgroundInteraction` codegen-safe.
- Fixed Nitro callback typing in `example/src/App.tsx` by wrapping callbacks with `callback(...)`.
- Updated tracking and review in `tasks/todo.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Included supporting Phase 1 contract/type/util files in the commit:
  - `src/index.tsx`
  - `src/types/bottom-sheet.ts`
  - `src/utils/detents.ts`
  - `src/platform/fallback.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.contract.test.ts`
  - `docs/changelog-notes/README.md`
  - `docs/knowledge-index.md`

Validation run (pass):
- `yarn lint`
- `yarn typecheck`
- `yarn test`

Commit/push:
- `7dc3513` on `main`
- pushed to `origin/main`

Not outputting `<promise>DONE</promise>` because the full spec set is still incomplete (remaining tasks in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md` and unstaged local changes still exist in `ios/RnBottomSheet.swift`, `scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh`, `scripts/ralph-loop.sh`, `logs/`, `yarn.lock`).
