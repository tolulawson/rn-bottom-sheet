Phase 0/1 are complete, and no incomplete work items were found:

- `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md` is `## Status: COMPLETE`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` has no unchecked `- [ ]` tasks
- `gh issue list --state open` returned no open issues
- No external tracker resources are configured (`list_mcp_resources` returned empty)

Re-verification gates passed:

- `yarn lint` (0 errors, 3 warnings in generated `coverage/lcov-report/*`)
- `yarn typecheck`
- `yarn test` (`13/13` suites passed, `44` passed tests, `19` todo)
- `yarn docs:check` (`Knowledge base check passed`)
- iOS build: `xcodebuild ... build` succeeded with `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`
- Maestro gate remains non-blocking because `E2E Gate State` is `deferred` in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md`

Blocked before Phase 4 commit/push due unrelated pre-existing working tree changes I did not make:

- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`
- `PROMPT_build.md`
- `PROMPT_plan.md`
- `scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh`
- `scripts/ralph-loop.sh`
- plus generated `coverage/`, `logs/`, and `yarn.lock`

Choose how to proceed:
1. Commit only this iteration’s intended updates.
2. Commit all current workspace changes together.
3. Stop without committing/pushing.
