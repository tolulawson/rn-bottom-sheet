I found unexpected pre-existing changes in the working tree (multiple modified/untracked files I didn’t create this turn).  
Per your repo rules, I have to stop and ask how you want to proceed.

Choose one:
1. Continue on this dirty state and I’ll make only minimal targeted edits for this Ralph re-verification pass.
2. Pause while you clean/stash, then I continue from a clean tree.
