# Ralph Build Mode

Based on Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph Wiggum methodology.

---

## Phase 0: Orient

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to understand project principles and constraints.

---

## Phase 1: Discover Work Items

Search for incomplete work from these sources (in order):

1. **specs/ folder** — Look for `.md` files NOT marked `## Status: COMPLETE`
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** — If exists, find unchecked `- [ ]` tasks
3. **GitHub Issues** — Check for open issues (if this is a GitHub repo)
4. **Any task tracker** — Jira, Linear, etc. if configured

Pick the **HIGHEST PRIORITY** incomplete item:
- Lower numbers = higher priority (001 before 010)
- `[HIGH]` before `[MEDIUM]` before `[LOW]`
- Bugs/blockers before features

Before implementing, search the codebase to verify it's not already done.

---

## Phase 1b: Re-Verification Mode (No Incomplete Work Found)

**If ALL specs appear complete**, don't just exit — do a quality check:

1. **Randomly pick** one completed spec from `specs/`
2. **Strictly re-verify** ALL its acceptance criteria:
   - Run the actual tests mentioned in the spec
   - Manually verify each criterion is truly met
   - Check edge cases
   - Look for regressions
3. **If any criterion fails**: Unmark the spec as complete and fix it
4. **If all pass**: Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` to confirm quality

This ensures the codebase stays healthy even when "nothing to do."

---

## Phase 2: Implement

Implement the selected spec/task completely:
- Follow the spec's requirements exactly
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Add tests as needed

---

## Phase 3: Validate

Run the project's test suite and verify:
- All tests pass
- No lint errors
- The spec's acceptance criteria are 100% met

---

## Phase 3b: Conditional Maestro MCP E2E Gate (Example App)

Identify the active feature spec and check its E2E gate marker:
- Look for `E2E Gate State: deferred|required` in `specs/<feature>/spec.md`.
- Default to `deferred` if the marker is missing.

Gate behavior:
- If `deferred`: do NOT block this loop iteration. Log that Maestro MCP was skipped and why.
- If `required`: Maestro MCP is a hard gate for completion.

When `required`, run Maestro MCP against the example app and verify at least:
- sheet opens from example UI
- sheet dismisses cleanly
- detent interaction works
- primary in-sheet navigation flow works

If any required Maestro MCP flow fails, do NOT output `<promise>DONE</promise>`.

---

## Phase 4: Commit & Update

1. Mark the spec/task as complete (add `## Status: COMPLETE` to spec file)
2. `git add -A`
3. `git commit` with a descriptive message
4. `git push`

---

## Completion Signal

**CRITICAL:** Only output the magic phrase when the work is 100% complete.

Check:
- [ ] Implementation matches all requirements
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Maestro MCP gate satisfied (or explicitly deferred in the active spec)
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Spec marked as complete

**If ALL checks pass, output:** `<promise>DONE</promise>`

**If ANY check fails:** Fix the issue and try again. Do NOT output the magic phrase.

# Ralph Wiggum

> Autonomous AI coding with spec-driven development

## What is Ralph Wiggum?

Ralph Wiggum combines **Geoffrey Huntley's iterative bash loop** with **spec-driven development** for fully autonomous AI-assisted software development.

The key insight: **Fresh context each iteration**. Each loop starts a new agent process with a clean context window, preventing context overflow and degradation.

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Include tests because the specification requires automated verification coverage for API and integration behavior.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (`[US1]`, `[US2]`, `[US3]`)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare feature scaffolding, generated bindings workflow, and test harness entry points.

- [x] T001 Create feature README entry and scope note in docs/changelog-notes/README.md

# Feature Specification: Native iOS Sheet Bindings

**Feature Branch**: `001-native-ios-sheet-bindings`  
**Created**: 2026-02-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a React Native library that provides native iOS sheet bindings using Nitro Views with React Native children, dynamic detents, React Navigation integration, in-sheet navigation, and Reanimated-compatible APIs."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Present Native Sheet Content (Priority: P1)

As a React Native developer, I can present and dismiss a native-feeling iOS sheet that renders arbitrary React Native child content so that product experiences match Apple sheet behavior.

**Why this priority**: This is the core product value and the minimum viable capability for the package.

**Independent Test**: In an example app, the developer can open/close a sheet and see custom React Native children rendered correctly without writing custom native code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a screen using the library, **When** the developer triggers open state, **Then** a native iOS sheet appears and displays provided child content.

**Planning export and task updates**
codex
Plan is in place and verified; I’m now implementing `T028` by exporting the navigation adapter APIs/types from `src/index.tsx`, then I’ll mark task state and run lint/typecheck/test.

**Updating task status and considering export test**
codex
The export change is in; next I’m synchronizing task tracking (`specs/.../tasks.md` and `tasks/todo.md`) and then executing verification commands.

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Align docs, verification scripts, and release readiness.

- [ ] T032 [P] Update public usage documentation and API surface in README.md
- [ ] T033 [P] Record architecture decisions and constraints updates in docs/adr/ADR-0001-ios-sheet-engine.md
- [ ] T034 Add verification and runbook notes for this feature in docs/implementation-plan-v1.md
- [ ] T035 Execute validation commands and capture results in tasks/todo.md
- [ ] T036 [P] Add Maestro example-app E2E flow definitions in example/.maestro/sheet-core-flows.yaml
- [ ] T037 [P] Add Maestro MCP runbook notes and invocation expectations in docs/implementation-plan-v1.md
- [ ] T038 Execute conditional Maestro MCP gate and update `E2E Gate State` in specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md (`deferred` -> `required` only when stability criteria are met)

**Verifying file content length**
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'tail -n 120 tasks/todo.md' in /Users/tolu/Desktop/dev/rn-bottom-sheet succeeded in 52ms:
  - Added `BottomSheet` public wrapper in `src/components/BottomSheet.tsx` with controlled/uncontrolled support, imperative refs, fallback-safe behavior, and native callback wiring.
  - Added wrapper validation + mapping tests in `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.wrapper.test.ts` and switched the example app to the wrapper API.
  - Added lifecycle callback unit coverage in `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.lifecycle.test.ts` and refactored lifecycle event mapping into `createLifecycleHandlers` in `src/components/bottom-sheet-utils.ts`, now used by `src/components/BottomSheet.tsx`.
  - Re-verified this iteration with passing `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, and `yarn test`.
- Residual Risks:
  - `NativeBackgroundInteraction` bridge typing is wider (`string | number`) than intended semantic domain and depends on JS-side validation/documentation for stricter correctness.
  - Swift detent validation currently logs invalid configuration and falls back/defaults instead of surfacing explicit JS exceptions through the bridge.
- Follow-ups:
  - Add explicit JS-level validation around `backgroundInteraction` before sending values to native layer.
  - Add iOS integration coverage for wrapper-driven lifecycle transitions and dismissal reasons.

## Ralph Iteration 2026-02-12 (Phase 1 Verification Blocker)

- [x] Confirm highest-priority unfinished Phase 1 item and verify it is not already complete
- [x] Regenerate Nitro artifacts for current `src/RnBottomSheet.nitro.ts` contract
- [x] Fix callback wiring/type mismatches in `example/src/App.tsx` so `yarn typecheck` passes
- [x] Run and pass: `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn test`
- [x] Record verification outcomes in Review section and update completed checkboxes

## Review

- Date: 2026-02-12
- Reviewer: Codex (GPT-5)
- Findings:
  - Ralph iteration `T027`: added `src/navigation/bottom-sheet-adapter.ts` with optional navigation sync helpers (`createBottomSheetNavigationAdapter` and `useBottomSheetNavigation`) that map route state to controlled sheet props and avoid circular open/close dispatch when state is already aligned.
  - Added `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet-adapter.test.ts` to verify route-state mapping, open/close callback propagation, and loop-prevention behavior for matching states.
  - Marked `T027` complete in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md`.
  - Re-verified this iteration with passing `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, and `yarn test`.
  - Ralph iteration `T026`: added `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.reanimated.test.ts` to lock the documented Reanimated compatibility contract for `createAnimatedComponent` wrapping of both `BottomSheet` and `BottomSheetView`, including ref-method continuity and animated prop pass-through behavior.
  - No production-code changes were required for `T026`; the existing wrapper/native export surface already satisfied the contract once coverage was added.
  - Marked `T026` complete in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md`.
  - Re-verified this iteration with passing `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, and `yarn test`.
  - Ralph iteration `T025`: added `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.navigation.test.ts` to verify navigation-style controlled state synchronization, native close-intent callback propagation, and callback-only controlled imperative flow to avoid circular present/dismiss loops.
  - Marked `T025` complete in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md`.
  - Re-verified this iteration with passing `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, and `yarn test`.
  - Ralph iteration `T024`: expanded `example/src/App.tsx` with detent snap controls, behavior toggles (`grabberVisible`, `allowSwipeToDismiss`, `expandsWhenScrolledToEdge`, and cycled `backgroundInteraction`), and ref-driven snap usage in the example.
  - Updated `example/src/__tests__/sheet-open-dismiss.integration.test.tsx` to validate new controls with a ref-capable `BottomSheet` mock and assertions for toggles/detent transitions.
  - Marked `T024` complete in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md` and synchronized `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` completion tracking.
  - Re-verified this iteration with passing `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, and `yarn test`.

**Planning next task iteration**

I committed and pushed the `T028` change. I’m doing a quick hygiene check of `tasks/lessons.md` now to stay aligned with your workflow rules before deciding the next iteration step.

## Template

- Date:
- Trigger:
- Mistake Pattern:
- Prevention Rule:
- Action Taken:

## Entries

- Date: 2026-02-12
- Trigger: User clarified "tax" meant "tasks" and requested direct execution.
- Mistake Pattern: Treating ambiguous phrasing as a blocking clarification point instead of acting on clear intent.
- Prevention Rule: When user intent is operationally clear, execute directly and interpret minor wording ambiguity in context.
- Action Taken: Added docs/tasks scaffolding and committed plan artifacts without further gating.

- Date: 2026-02-12
- Trigger: User redirected scope from Bun migration to fixing a specific CI workflow failure.

 succeeded in 52ms:
    88	  - `yarn nitrogen` initially failed due Nitro parser limitations in `src/RnBottomSheet.nitro.ts` (inline union type and mixed string-literal/number union). Resolved by extracting `NativeDetentType` and widening `NativeBackgroundInteraction` bridge type to `string | number`.
    89	  - `yarn typecheck` initially failed in `example/src/App.tsx` because Nitro view callbacks were passed as plain functions. Resolved by wrapping callback props with `callback(...)` from `react-native-nitro-modules`.
    90	  - `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, and `yarn test` now pass.
    91	  - Added `fit` detent support to public type model and deterministic JS/native detent normalization rules (sorted low-to-high, deduped resolved values, unique custom ids).
    92	  - Added detent validation coverage and native mapping tests in `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.detents.test.ts`.
    93	  - Added `BottomSheet` public wrapper in `src/components/BottomSheet.tsx` with controlled/uncontrolled support, imperative refs, fallback-safe behavior, and native callback wiring.
    94	  - Added wrapper validation + mapping tests in `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.wrapper.test.ts` and switched the example app to the wrapper API.
    95	  - Added lifecycle callback unit coverage in `src/__tests__/bottom-sheet.lifecycle.test.ts` and refactored lifecycle event mapping into `createLifecycleHandlers` in `src/components/bottom-sheet-utils.ts`, now used by `src/components/BottomSheet.tsx`.

**Summarizing final report details**
codex
Selected and completed highest-priority truly incomplete spec task: `T028` (US3) from `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md:104`.

Changes made:
- Exported navigation adapter APIs and types from package root in `src/index.tsx:86`.
- Marked `T028` complete in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/tasks.md:104`.
- Added iteration plan/results tracking in `tasks/todo.md:209` and review notes in `tasks/todo.md:97`.

Validation:
- Ran `yarn lint && yarn typecheck && yarn test` successfully.
- Jest result: 10/10 suites passed, 32 tests passed.

Git:
- Commit: `a2713ab` (`feat: export navigation adapter APIs from package root`)
- Pushed to `origin/main`.

Ralph gate status:
- `E2E Gate State` in `specs/001-native-ios-sheet-bindings/spec.md` is `deferred`, so Maestro MCP is non-blocking and was skipped this iteration.
- Remaining incomplete tasks exist (`T029+`), so `<promise>DONE</promise>` is not emitted.

Next step:
1. Continue with `T029` (`src/components/BottomSheetNativeView.tsx`) as the next highest-priority unchecked spec task.
